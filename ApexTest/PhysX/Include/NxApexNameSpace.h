\brief Internal namespace for authorable asset types

For examples, there are entries in this namespace for "ApexRenderMesh", "NxClothingAsset",
"DestructibleAsset", etc...
The values stored in this namespace are the namespace IDs of the authorable asset types.
So if your module needs to get a pointer to a FooAsset created by module Foo, you can ask
the ApexSDK for that asset's namespace ID.

\brief A namespace for graphical material names

Each name in this namespace maps to a pointer to a game-engine defined graphical material data
structure. APEX does not interpret or dereference this pointer in any way. APEX provides this
pointer to the NxUserRenderResource::setMaterial(void *material) callback to the rendering engine.
This mapping allows APEX assets to refer to game engine materials (e.g.: texture maps and shader
programs) without imposing any limitations on what a game engine graphical material can contain.
The NRP will not automatically generate release requests for names in this namespace.

APEX provides an array of these pointers in NxUserRenderVertexBufferDesc::customBuffersIdents,
which is passed the rendering engine when requesting allocation of vertex buffers.
