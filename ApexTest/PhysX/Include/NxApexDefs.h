 \def NX_APEX_SDK_VERSION
 \brief APEX Framework API version

 Used for making sure you are linking to the same version of the SDK files
 that you have included.  Should be incremented with every API change.

 \def NX_APEX_SDK_RELEASE
 \brief APEX SDK Release version

 Used for conditionally compiling user code based on the APEX SDK release version.

 \def DYNAMIC_CAST
 \brief Determines use of dynamic_cast<> by APEX modules

 \def APEX_USE_GRB
 \brief Determines use of GPU Rigid Bodies by APEX modules

 \def APEX_USE_PARTICLES
 \brief Determines use of particle-related APEX modules

 \def NX_APEX_DEFAULT_NO_INTEROP_IMPLEMENTATION
 \brief Provide API stubs with no CUDA interop support

 Use this to add default implementations of interop-related interfaces for NxUserRenderer.
