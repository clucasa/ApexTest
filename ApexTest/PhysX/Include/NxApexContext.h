\brief Iterate over all renderable NxApexActors in an NxApexContext

An NxApexRenderableIterator is a lock-safe iterator over all renderable
NxApexActors in an NxApexContext.  Actors which are locked are skipped in the initial
pass and deferred till the end.  The returned NxApexRenderable is locked by the
iterator and remains locked until you call getNext().

The NxApexRenderableIterator is also deletion safe.  If an actor is deleted
from the NxApexContext in another thread, the iterator will skip that actor.

An NxApexRenderableIterator should not be held for longer than a single simulation
step.  It should be allocated on demand and released after use.
