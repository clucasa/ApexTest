/**
\brief Base class for all APEX Descriptor classes

A descriptor class of type NxXDesc is typically passed to a createX() function.  Descriptors have
several advantages over simply passing a number of explicit parameters to create():

- all parameters can have default values so the user only needs to know about the ones he needs to change
- new parameters can be added without changing the user code, along with defaults
- the user and the SDK can validate the parameter's correctness using isValid()
- if creation fails, the user can look at the code of isValid() to see what exactly is not being accepted by the SDK
- some object types can save out their state into descriptors again for serialization

Care should be taken that derived descriptor classes do not initialize their base class members multiple times,
once in the constructor, and once in setToDefault()!
